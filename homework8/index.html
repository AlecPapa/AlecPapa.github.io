            World renowned British physicist professor Stephen Hawking has died at the age of 76, a spokesman for his family has said.
            <br> He passed away peacefully at his home in Cambridge in the early hours of Wednesday March 14.
            <br> In a statement his family said: “His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. He once said, ‘It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love.’ We will miss him
            forever.”
            <br> He was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease in 1964 at the age of 22, and given just a few years to live.
            <br> However he prevailed and survived to become one of the most famous scientists of the modern age.
            <br> He was best known for his work on black holes, the mysterious infinitely dense regions of compressed matter where the normal laws of physics break down, which dominated the whole of his academic life. </div>
