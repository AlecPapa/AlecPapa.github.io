                <!-- <h2>(ABSTRACT) Dark Side</h2> -->
                <p class="lead">
                    Tongqi (gay’s wives) in mainland China face tremendous mental stress and social marginalisation due to their particular identities. Several pieces of research from both official and non-governmental sources indicate that the number of gays in mainland
                    China is at least 20 million. 80% of them has got married or will be married. In other words, The group size of Tongqi is around 16 million, which can’t be underestimated.
                </p>

                <h2 class="titleziding">POINT OF ORIGIN: WHY DO THEY WANT A NORMAL MARRIAGE?</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    “I certainly won’t get married. However, lots of my (gay) friends will get married (with women) eventually,” when asked if he will get married, Eggy Uen told me, “I don’t even consider sham marriage (形婚), since I think, in marriage, both sides should
                    take a great responsibility.”
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Uen is currently working in Shanghai. “Say frankly, Shanghai is an inclusive and dynamic city compared with other small cities in China,” he sighed, “the situation is harsher there for the LGBT group members coming out.”
                </p>
                <p class="lead">The social factor is one of the biggest obstacles for a gay living everyday life. Other than people’s bias, the working environment is quite important as well. The gays working in the government or state-owned enterprises are most likely
                    to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity. Because from the traditional Chinese view, gays are people not of the same clan.</p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Another social factor is the ageing of the population. The government is promoting the two-child policy. As everyone knows, neither two men can’t give birth to a child. Under this background, the legalisation of same-sex marriage is far away and not within
                    the foreseeable future.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">“There are three ways to be unfilial, (but) the worst kind is not to produce offspring (不孝有三/無後為大),” Uen quoted an old Chinese saying. “Most Chinese parents won’t allow their child to be DINK (double income, no kids). Inheritance is the
                    most important thing.”
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Besides, unknowing parents urging their child to get married is quite a common phenomenon inside a Chinese family. And to reproduce is a human instinct.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    In short, social factors and family factors are pressuring gays all the time, which is the spring of the Tongqi issue.

                <p class="lead">
                    “We were introduced to each other on Sep 9 2017. About one month later, right after the National Day (Oct 10), two families gathered together and finalised the marriage,” recollected Kelly Sun, a junior high school teacher living in Ji’an, Jiangxi.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Back then, Sun was 27 years old. Her ex-husband told her that he’s keen on children and wanted to have a baby as soon as possible. Her ex-husband worked at a hospital. He asked his colleague to help him calculate the ovulatory period and urged Sun to
                    prepare for pregnancy.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    “Our son was born at the end of August (2018). Subsequently, he ignored my existence and devoted all his attention to our son. I thought it just because feelings will gradually fade until I found his little secret when I accidentally saw his chat history
                    with a man. He told a man that he’s afraid of falling in love with him, and ”
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    “In addition to this, I found his Blued (the largest gay social network app in the world) account, which registered long before we get married. His role is 0.5 (a Chinese gay slang, representing ‘versatile’). At that time, I don’t even know what the meaning
                    of 0.5 is. Then I did some research on gays. I suddenly realised that I was tricked into marriage.” Sun added.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Sun and her ex-husband finally divorced last year. However, they haven’t reached an agreement on the division of property or custody of their son. Sun’s ex-husband and her parents often harassed her in an attempt to win custody of their child and protect
                    their reputation.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Sun also told me that she was suffering from depression last year, and sometimes she even wanted to commit suicide.

                <!--<h2>A Sexual Violence</h2>-->
                <p class="lead">
                    According to a cross-sectional study done by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03630242.2016.1145171">Xianhong Li and others in 2015</a>, a majority (59.8%) of women reported suicidal thoughts after discovering
                    their husbands’ MSM (men who have sex with men) behaviour. And 10% of them attempt suicide.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p class="lead">
                    Li also stressed that STDs (sexually transmitted disease) including HIV is a significant issue. Especially when their husbands have an affair with other men, unprotected sex could lead to irrevocable health damage beyond psychological trauma.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    In the report, Li did a demographic of Tongqi, which showed that most of his interviewees are highly educated urban residents. And a majority of (70.6%) of them have children.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    When asked why their partners choose heterosexual marriage, the top answers were: (1) to satisfy the men’s parents, (2) to show society that they were “normal”, (3) to have a child, and (4) to fulfil their social duty.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Another noteworthy point is that 80 out of 126 interviewees married their (ex-)husbands without knowing each other for more than a year.

                <h1 class="titleziding">Case of Xenia Ma: "I don't hate him, he has his own difficulties"</h1>

                <p class="lead">
                    “Through the extension in my room, I accidentally heard him chatting with a man. The conversation was not very explicit, but I felt a little abnormal,” said Xenia Ma (pseudonym), a 51-year old Tongqi who has divorced the year before last. “It was 2005,
                    and our child was 12 years old.”
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    “The reason why we divorced only the year before last was that I discovered the fact that the whole family had already known that he was a gay,” Ma added, “as thus, there is no point in maintaining the marriage.”
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    When asked why some gays choose to marry a heterosexual woman, Ma considered, “Gay who cheated to marry may not think it would cause great harm to the one he married. Because he only considers his own pressure and interests. He may even feel wronged.”
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Although Ma believes that this behaviour is a severe mistake, she doesn’t resent her ex-husband. In her opinion, sexual orientation is innate and cannot be changed.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Ma joined a mutual support WeChat group just before she divorced. In the group, 170 out of 240 members are still in the marriage. A lot of them won’t divorce for two reasons: 1. Worry about social stigma towards divorced women; 2. Try to protect their
                    husband and children.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    During her leisure time, Ma shared her view on Weibo, Zhihu, and WeChat public accounts and called gay men not to scam to marriage. Ma believed that, with the improvement of social tolerance and the weakening of Chinese traditional clan concepts, the
                    number of Tongqi would gradually decrease.

Li himself is a gay who has come out ten years ago.

                </p>


                <p class="lead">
                    When asked how scam marriage (騙婚) developed in China, Li analysed, “For those born in the 50s and 60s, coming out is hard to imagine. Before the 1990s, homosexuality still belonged to the crime of sodomy and hooliganism in the criminal law in mainland
                    China. Hence, most gays hid their identities and chose heterosexual marriages.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    “After the acquittal of homosexuality, the generation (post-80s) of gays began to identify with themselves. Facing social and family pressures, most of them still step into heterosexual marriages. But some started to seek sham marriages which are marrying
                    with a lesbian.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    The post-90s and post-95s, with the cultural integration and the explosion of information sources, began to pursue self-realisation gradually.<img style="float: right;margin: 21px 0 20px 20px;" src="./images/4.jpg"> Therefore, in terms
                    of coming out, the proportion is getting higher and higher.”
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Another younger organisation called <a href="https://weibo.com/p/1005056073922309/home?from=page_100505&mod=TAB&pids=plc_main">Mote Tongqi Support Group </a> is mainly active on Weibo. It holds the slogan “Resist (gay’s) scam marriage,
                    Safeguards women’s right to know!”
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Other than that, lots of Tongqi Support Groups on WeChat have been helping Tongqi understand their partners and give them strength to better fight for their rights.
