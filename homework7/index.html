        As shown above, Hong Kong government spend about 52 billion HKD on "caring and sharing" issue. I divided them into three parts base on the benefited groups. “M”(in orange) stands for middle class. “G”(in green) stands for grassroots. And “C”(in blue)
        stands for commercial world. The figures are in “million HKD”.
